## 🧠 About Me

> Passionate about breaking, building, and securing systems!

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast who loves building tools, solving problems, and understanding how systems work under the hood. From malware analysis to writing my own recon scanners, I enjoy working at the intersection of **network security, ethical hacking, and full-stack backend development**.

- 💻 I write code in `Java`, `Python`, `C/C++`, and `Bash`
- 🌐 I'm working with firewalls, scanners, malware sandboxes, and secure socket programming
- 📚 Constantly learning — currently diving deep into **reverse engineering**, **penetration testing**, and **threat intelligence**
